# Week 3 Project Self-Assessment

## Instructor's question set

### 1. Query classification:

**1a: For query classification: How many unique categories did you see in your rolled up training data when you set the minimum number of queries per category to 1000? To 10000?**

| min_n_queries_per_category | n_unique_categories |
| :------------------------- | :------------------ |
| 1                          | 1486                |
| 1000                       | 388                 |
| 10000                      | 70                  |

**1b. For query classification: What were the best values you achieved for R@1, R@3, and R@5? You should have tried at least a few different models, varying the minimum number of queries per category, as well as trying different fastText parameters or query normalization. Report at least 2 of your runs.**

### 2. Integrating query classification with search:

**2a. For integrating query classification with search: Give 2 or 3 examples of queries where you saw a dramatic positive change in the results because of filtering. Make sure to include the classifier output for those queries.**

TODO

**2b. For integrating query classification with search: Give 2 or 3 examples of queries where filtering hurt the results, either because the classifier was wrong or for some other reason. Again, include the classifier output for those queries.**
